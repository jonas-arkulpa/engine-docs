Query batching allows your client to batch multiple queries into one request.  This means that if you render several view components within a short time interval, for example a navbar, sidebar, and content, and each of those do their own GraphQL query, the queries can be sent together in a single roundtrip.  

A batch of queries can be sent by simply sending a JSON-encoded array of queries in the request:

```js
[ 
 { "query": "{
  feed(limit: 2, type: NEW) {
    postedBy {
      login
    }
    repository {
      name
      owner {
        login
      }
    }
  }
}" }, 
 { "query": "query CurrentUserForLayout {
  currentUser {
    __typename
    avatar_url
    login
  }
}" }
] 
```

Batched requests to servers that donâ€™t support batching fail without explicit code to handle batching, however Engine ships with batched request handling built-in.

If a batch of queries is sent, the batches are fractured by the Engine proxy and individual queries are sent to origins in parallel.  Engine will wait for all the responses to complete and send a single response back to the client.  The response will be an array of GraphQL results:

```js
[{
  "data": {
    "feed": [
      {
        "postedBy": {
          "login": "AleksandraKaminska"
        },
        "repository": {
          "name": "GitHubApp",
          "owner": {
            "login": "AleksandraKaminska"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "postedBy": {
          "login": "ashokhein"
        },
        "repository": {
          "name": "memeryde",
          "owner": {
            "login": "ashokhein"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
},
{
  "data": {
    "currentUser": {
      "__typename": "User",
      "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11861843?v=4",
      "login": "johannakate"
    }
  }
}]
```

Apollo Client has built-in support for batching queries in your client application.  To learn how to use query batching with Apollo Client, visit the in-depth guide on our package [`apollo-link-batch-http`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/batch-http.html).

If your origin supports batching and you'd like to pass entire batches through, set `"supportsBatch": true` within the origins section of the configuration:

```js
const engine = new ApolloEngine({
  apiKey: "ENGINE_API_KEY",
  origins: [{
    supportsBatch: true,
  }],
});
```

Add this setting, and you're good to go! 

If you have questions, we're always available in the public [Apollo Slack #engine channel](https://www.apollographql.com/#slack).
